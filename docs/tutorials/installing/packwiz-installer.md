# Pack Installation using packwiz-installer

[packwiz-installer] is a Java-based installer that allows for automatic installation and updates of packwiz packs! It can be used with MultiMC as a prelaunch task, or on servers as part of your start script, and supports side-only mods as well as optional mods with a fancy GUI.

To distribute a packwiz modpack, you'll first want to set up a web hosting service (such as Netlify, Github Pages, GitLab Pages) so that your pack files are accessible from a HTTP/HTTPS link.

## Creating a MultiMC instance for your modpack

To distribute the modpack as a MultiMC instance:

1. Create a barebones MultiMC instance, with the modloader and Minecraft version you want (memory allocation overrides are also a good idea)
2. Download packwiz-installer-bootstrap from https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases and place it in the instance Minecraft folder

    This is the same folder as options.txt - MultiMC will call it `.minecraft` or `minecraft` depending on your system.

3. Go to Edit Instance -> Settings -> Custom commands, then check the Custom Commands box and paste the following command into the pre-launch command field:
    - `"$INST_JAVA" -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://[your-server]/pack.toml`
      (where `https://[your-server]/pack.toml` is the HTTP URL your `pack.toml` file is hosted at)
4. Use the Export Instance function to export your pack as a `.zip` file (which can be distributed similarly to your pack via a web hosting service)

To install your pack, users just need to add it with Add instance -> Import from zip - then packwiz-installer does the rest, keeping it up to date every time the game is launched!

## Using a modpack with a server

You can use [packwiz-installer] to download non-client mods (side either `both` or `server`), for example:

    java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar -g -s server https://[your-server]/pack.toml

- `-g` flag to disable the GUI
- `-s server` to download only server-side mods.

itzg's [docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) has built in support for packwiz. You can pass the `PACKWIZ_URL` environment variable pointing to your pack's TOML file, and the container will bootstrap packwiz-installer and install/update the provided pack. See [the documentation](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server#running-a-server-with-a-packwiz-modpack) for more information.
